adds quotes from /r/ShitRimWorldSays to RimWorld loading screens

[h2]Important[/h2]

If you're easily offended, please do not install this mod.

[url=https://reddit.com/r/ShitRimworldSays]/r/ShitRimworldSays[/url] is a collection of the funniest (and often most gruesome) Rimworld quotes, [i]taken out of context[/i]. I have absolutely no control over what quotes actually end up on the reddit, or get shown to you.

[h2]Features[/h2]

Automatically downloads the latest and greatest quotes from [url=https://reddit.com/r/ShitRimworldSays]/r/ShitRimworldSays[/url], and displays them on loading screens.

Includes an option to disable the gameplay tips that are usually shown.

For example;[img]https://i.ibb.co/Tq6qDCv/Screenshot-2020-04-21-23-32-27-2.png[/img][img]https://i.ibb.co/6FTLwJD/Screenshot-2020-04-21-23-31-45-2.png[/img][img]https://i.ibb.co/gDPjGrn/Screenshot-2020-04-21-23-31-35-2.png[/img][img]https://i.ibb.co/DDhgp9w/Screenshot-2020-04-21-23-31-22-2.png[/img]

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]

Some quotes make no sense (often posts with images), and some are way too big for the available space. Not much I can do about it, sorry!
