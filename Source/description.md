[/r/ShitRimworldSays](https://reddit.com/r/ShitRimworldSays) is a collection of the funniest (and often most gruesome) Rimworld quotes, _taken out of context_. I have absolutely no control over what quotes actually end up on the reddit, or get shown to you.

# Features

Automatically downloads the latest and greatest quotes from [/r/ShitRimworldSays](https://reddit.com/r/ShitRimworldSays), and displays them on loading screens.

Includes an option to disable the gameplay tips that are usually shown.

# Known Issues

Some quotes make no sense (often posts with images), and some are way too big for the available space. Not much I can do about it, sorry!
