adds quotes from /r/Sh*tRimWorldSays to RimWorld loading screens

## Important


If you're easily offended, please do not install this mod.

[/r/Sh*tRimworldSays](https://t.ly/mW0u0) is a collection of the funniest (and often most gruesome) Rimworld quotes, *taken out of context*. I have absolutely no control over what quotes actually end up on the reddit, or get shown to you.

## Features


Automatically downloads the latest and greatest quotes from [/r/Sh*tRimworldSays](https://t.ly/mW0u0), and displays them on loading screens.

Includes an option to disable the gameplay tips that are usually shown.

## Known Issues


Some quotes make no sense (often posts with images), and some are way too big for the available space. Not much I can do about it, sorry!
